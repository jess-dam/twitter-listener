## Twitter Streaming Project :duck: :robot:

This project is a web crawler that allows you to set up a bot that will continually listen to Twitter for a particular trend or phrase that is input by the user. It uses the Tweepy library to connect with Twitter from Python.

#### Setting Up Twitter Developer Access
To be able to get this project connected, you'll need to create a Twitter account if you don't have one, to be able to connect it to the developer app - this helps Twitter know that the app isn't being used for anything malicous.

After connecting to the developer app, create an app from the `Overview` page to be able to generate the keys and tokens you'll be using to login via your Python code.

Enter your keys and tokens into the `twitter.conf` file to start using the project

__keep your keys safe and do not share with other people__
